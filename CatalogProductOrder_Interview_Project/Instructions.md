#  Instructions

1. Implement search in ContentView. Search should do a case insensative compare based on CatalogProduct Name.
2. Add a loading indicator when fetching the data. 
3. When a CatalogProduct is selected, present a module view. A mock up of the view can be found in folder structure. CatalogProductDetails.png
4. For CatalogProductDetails, The add button should be disabled until user adds a quanity.
5. When add button is pressed, the view should be dismissed, and the 'Items' button on the main viewController should be updated. 
6. Bonus #1: Open Bonus.swift and implement the function. Seriously, this is just for fun. No expectations. Our code base relies heavily on functional programming. If hired, we will teach you this. It looks odd at first, but most quickly understand. 

Thoughts / Suggestions

- Please use any 3rd party frameworks you think are necessary.
- Be prepared to explain how you would test this code.
